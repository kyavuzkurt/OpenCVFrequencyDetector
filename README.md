# Video Processing and Frequency Detection

This repository provides tools for video processing, including video cropping, frequency detection, and color-based object tracking.

## Requirements

To run the code, install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Video Cropping and Frequency Detection

The main script for video cropping and frequency detection is main.py. It processes a video file, crops regions of interest, and analyzes the cropped segments.
Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

bash

python main.py --input <input_video_file> --output <output_directory>

Template Management

The trackerdemo.py script provides functionalities for creating, loading, and deleting templates for object tracking.
Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

bash

python trackerdemo.py --action <create|load|delete> --template <template_file>

Color Tracking Demo

The colortrackerdemo.py script demonstrates color-based object tracking using predefined HSV ranges.
Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command:

bash

python colortrackerdemo.py --input <input_video_file> --output <output_directory>

Logging

The scripts use Python's logging module to log debug information. The log level is set to DEBUG to provide detailed information about the execution.
Output

The scripts generate CSV files containing the detected object coordinates and other relevant data. The output files are named based on the current date and time to ensure uniqueness.
