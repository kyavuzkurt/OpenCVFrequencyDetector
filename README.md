# Video Processing and Frequency Detection

# Color Detector GUI

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for detecting colors in videos using a multi-tracker. The application allows users to select a video file, specify parameters, and run the color detection process. The results can be plotted and saved.

## Features

- Select video files for processing.
- Choose color to detect (blue or green).
- Set parameters such as amplitude, frequency, and number of objects to track.
- Option to plot the results after processing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kyavuzkurt/OpenCVFrequencyDetector.git
    cd OpenCVFrequencyDetector
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the GUI application:
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```

2. Use the GUI to:
    - Browse and select a video file.
    - Choose the color to detect.
    - Set the amplitude, frequency, and number of objects.(Frequency, amplitude and percentage are for naming convention only.)
    - Optionally, enable plotting of results.

3. Click "Run" to start the color detection process.

## Code Overview

### `run.py`

This file contains the main GUI application using Tkinter. It allows users to input parameters and run the color detection process.

### `main.py`

This script handles the command-line interface for running the color detection. It parses arguments and initializes the `ColorDetector` class.

### `colordetector.py`

This module contains the `ColorDetector` class, which processes the video, detects the specified color, and tracks objects.

### `plotter.py`

This script reads the output CSV files generated by the `ColorDetector` and plots the results using Matplotlib.

## Example

1. Select a video file.
2. Choose the color to detect (e.g., blue).
3. Set the parameters (e.g., amplitude, frequency).
4. Click "Run" to start the process.
5. If enabled, the results will be plotted and saved.
